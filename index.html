            <h3>Chicken</h3>
            <p>
                Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department
                of Health
                &
                Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites.[31]
                However, in
                Japan
                raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi
                style.
                Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw.[32]
    
                Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally
                grilled or
                by
                using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in
                cooking
                methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying.
                Western
                cuisine
                frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets,
                chicken
                lollipops
                or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos.
    
                Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of
                chicken.
                While
                these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other
                methods.[33]
    
                Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib meat". This is
                a
                misnomer,
                as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the breast meat.
                The
                breast
                is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped
                from the
                bone
                through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and
                marketed as
                chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed
                separately from
                the
                breast (pectoralis major). In the US, "tenders" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In
                the UK
                the
                strips of pectoralis minor are called "chicken mini-fillets".
    
                Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be
                simmered
                with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock.
    
                In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups,
                which are
                said
                to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are
                frequently
                sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or "chicken carcasses" and are
                purchased
                for soup or stock purposes.

            <h3>Beef</h3>
            <p>
                Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef
                since
                prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2]
    
                Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short
                ribs or
                steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other
                cuts are
                processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older,
                leaner
                (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties
                called blood
                sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue,
                tripe from the
                reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the
                brain
                (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to
                as mad cow
                disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries,
                prairie oysters,
                or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and
                used as
                natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called
                veal.
    
                Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding
                varies. The
                meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in
                the United
                States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage
                in pens as
                part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they
                are usually
                fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.
    
                Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production
                worldwide, after
                pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[5] In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the
                People's
                Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef
                and veal
                consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average
                Uruguayan ate
                over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the
                world. In
                comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while
                African
                countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.
    
                In 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China produced the most beef with 12.22 million tons, 9.9 million
                tons, and 6.46
                million tons respectively.[6] The top 3 beef exporting countries in 2019 were Australia (14.8% of total
                exports), the
                United States (13.4% of total exports), and Brazil (12.6% of total exports).[7] Beef production is also
                important to the
                economies of Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Belarus and Nicaragua.

            <h3>Sushi</h3>
            <p>
                Futomaki is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States, and comes in variations that take
                their names
                from their places of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops,
                spicy tuna,
                beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the tempura
                roll, where
                shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern
                United States,
                many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black
                rice, which
                appear in Japanese cuisine as well.
    
                Per Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen prior to
                serving in
                order to kill parasites.[40] Because of this and the relative difficulty of acquiring fresh seafood compared
                to Japan,
                raw seafood (e.g., sashimi) is not as prevalent a component in American-style sushi.
    
                Since rolls are often made to-order it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients
                desired (e.g.
                salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, tuna roll, shrimp or tuna tempura roll, etc.)
                Sushi-meshi 鮨飯 (also known as Su-meshi 酢飯, shari 舎利, or gohan ご飯) is a preparation of white, short-grained,
                Japanese
                rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. It has
                to be cooled
                to room temperature before being used for a filling in a sushi or else it will get too sticky while being
                seasoned.
                Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a
                wooden
                paddle (shamoji).
    
                Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain
                strains such
                as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness
                or
                glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested
                rice
                (shinmai) typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing.
                In some
                fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.
    
                There are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the
                variations
                are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses
                more salt; in
                Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.
